◘◘ Parsing

◘ Parse text data to numerical representation
  so that integrity checks can be performed

♦Parsing a numeric value from a valid data-pair
 Given a data-pair that maps to a numeric field
 when parsing the data-pair 
 then a valid decimal value is returned

♦Parsing a numeric value from an empty data-pair
 given a data-pair that maps to a numeric field
 and the data pair contains an empty value
 when parsing the data-pair
 then a empty data-pair exception is thrown

◘ Parse text data to time representation
  so that time values can be presented in a consistent format

♦Parsing a valid time value from a data-pair
 Given a data-pair that maps to a time field 
 when parsing the data-pair 
 then a valid decimal value is returned

♦Parsing a valid time value from a data-pair
 given a data-pair that maps to a time field
 and the data pair contains an empty value
 when parsing the data-pair
 then a empty data-pair exception is thrown


◘◘ Data Integrity Checks 

◘ VAT calculations

♦The VAT ammount should be re-calculated 
 and verified against the scraped amount

♦Duplicate fields should be compared to 
 ensure they are the same

♦The total-due should be re-calculated 
 and verified against the scraped amount
