=========================================================================
During the account activation process, 
the customer will supply account number and credentials

these credentials are used to access the billing company website
( the scraper needs this information )

A cross check can be done to check that the account number
that the customer has entered matches the account number on the
site

if this check fails the activation should be rejected and an appropriate
message should be sent back to the customer

	WHEN the account number is cross checked against the billing website
	THEN the account activation should be rejected
	AND an appropriate message should be sent back to the customer
