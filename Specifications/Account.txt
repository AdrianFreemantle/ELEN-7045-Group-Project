===================================================================
Account 
===================================================================
During the account activation process, 
the customer will supply account number and credentials

these credentials are used to access the billing company website
( the scraper needs this information )

A cross check can be done to check that the account number
that the customer has entered matches the account number on the
site

if this check fails the activation should be rejected and an appropriate
message should be sent back to the customer

*Customer cannot add a duplicate account	
	GIVEN a company name, account number and valid credentials are parsed
	WHEN an account is registered
	AND the company name, account number already exists
	THEN the new account should be rejected
	AND an appropriate message should be sent back to the customer

	GIVEN a company name, account number and valid credentials are parsed
	WHEN the account number is cross checked against the billing website
	AND the account number is invalid

Account Status
===================================================================
The user’s account status is changed from “active” to “inactive”. Once a user has updated their details,
their account status is changed to “trying”.

*reset inactive account status
	GIVEN an account status is "inactive"
	WHEN the user updated their details
	THEN the account status is set to "trying"

If the credentials are found to be invalid, the service should notify the user and request that
the user supply their updated credentials before the scrape is attempted again. The user’s
account status is changed from “active” to “inactive”. Once a user has updated their details,
their account status is changed to “trying”.

*set account status to inactive
	GIVEN an account status is "active"
	WHEN the account credentials is invalid
	THEN the account status is set to "inactive"
	
*set account status to active
	GIVEN an account status is "trying"
	WHEN a scrape was successful
	THEN the account status is set to "active"
