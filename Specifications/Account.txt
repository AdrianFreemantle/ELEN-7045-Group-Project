=========================================================================
During the account activation process, 
the customer will supply account number and credentials

these credentials are used to access the billing company website
( the scraper needs this information )

A cross check can be done to check that the account number
that the customer has entered matches the account number on the
site

if this check fails the activation should be rejected and an appropriate
message should be sent back to the customer


*valid account number supplied
	GIVEN an valid account number has been supplied by the customer
	WHEN the account number is cross checked against the billing website
	THEN the account activation should be accepted

*invalid valid account number supplied	
	GIVEN an invalid account number has been supplied by the customer
	WHEN the account number is cross checked against the billing website
	THEN the account activation should be rejected
	AND an appropriate message should be sent back to the customer
=========================================================================

The user’s account status is changed from “active” to “inactive”. Once a user has updated their details,
their account status is changed to “trying”.

*reset inactive account status
	GIVEN an account status is changed from active to inactive
	WHEN the user updated their details
	THEN the account status is set to retrying
